    "* this scenario, we're talking about free-flowing text in form of words, phrases, sentences and entire document\n",
    "* no inherent structure to text documents because there's a wide variety of words that can vary across documents and each sentence will be of variable length as compared to a fixed umber of data dimension in structured dataset\n",
    "* how can we represent text data for machines to understand? use a _vector space model_: (i.e term vector model) mathematical and algebraic model for transforming and representing text documents as numeric vectors of specific terms that form the vector dimensions\n",
    "* mathematically: let $D$ represent a document in vector space $VS$; the number of dimensions or columns for each document will be the total number of distinct terms or words for all documents in the vector space $VS = \\{W_1, W_2, \\dots, W_n\\}$ where there are $n$ distinct words across all documents. Now represent document $D$ in this vector space as follows: $D = \\{w_{D1}, w_{D2}, \\dots, w_{Dn}\\}$ where $W_{Dn}$ denotes weight for word $n$ in document $D$\n",
    "* weight is a numeric value and can be anything ranging from frequency of word in document, the average frequency of occurence, embedding weights, or even TF-IDF weight\n",
    "* important point: once we build feature engineering model, need to use the same process when extracting features from new documents to be predicted and not rebuild whole algorithm based on new documents\n"
